# Drawing Recognition AI

```diff

+ Explanation of Program  
This program allows the user to create a training data set amongst 3 user-chosen categories 
(for example, the shapes hexagon, heptagon, and octagon) where the user then draws images of 
such categories to create a training data set. 

The user also has the ability to rotate between models to train the program with (such as Random Forest Classifier,
K-Neibhgours Classifier, Linear SVC, and many more). 

Once the program has been trained with the chosen model, it can then classify user-drawn images with relative
accuracy. This program also provides additional features (to the user) such as the ability to increase and 
decrease the size of the brush stroke, to save the current training data set, and to load an
already existing training data set.


+ Modifications Made  
I made the following modifications to the program:
- Added an automated folder hierarchy system to store training data
- Modified the ordering of the training model rotation
- Added comments to the code for clarity
- Changed the GUI
